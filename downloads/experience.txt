Since February 2014, I had chance to work on environment-related molecular toxicology in Professor [Xu Yang](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1053/2297.htm)'s lab. That was the begining of my interest in research of public health. During my undergraduate study, I gradually cultivated a passion in biostatistics, and applied for the corresponding master degree.  

With the guidance of Professor [Bin Cheng](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/bc2159), I started to focus on developing multivariate count data modeling methods, and learnt how to undertake methodological research since February 2018. Understanding that the inspiration always comes from the practice, I also worked with Professor [Ying Wei](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/yw2148) to conduct dental malpractice data analysis since May 2018. I recognized the fact that better solutions always come from extensive experience, and made myself available to work on different applied projects. I had a research internship on analyzing microRNA sequencing data at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) from January to May in 2019 under supervision of Dr. [Li-Xuan Qin](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/li-xuan-qin).
