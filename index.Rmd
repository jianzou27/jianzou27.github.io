### Student of Biostatistics
<br>
I am pursuing MS of Biostatistics at [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), Columbia University and was awarded two BS degrees (Biotechnology and Applied Chemistry) at [School of Life Science](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/), Central China Normal University.  

Since February 2014, I had chance to work on environment-related molecular toxicology in Professor [Yang Xu](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1053/2297.htm)'s lab.That was the begining of my interest in research of public health.
