### Student of Biostatistics
<br>
I am completing MS of Biostatistics at [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), Columbia University. I was awarded two BS degrees (Biotechnology and Applied Chemistry) at [School of Life Science](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/), Central China Normal University.  

Since February 2014, I had chance to work on environment-related molecular toxicology in Professor [Xu Yang](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1053/2297.htm)'s lab. That was the begining of my interest in research of public health. During my undergraduate study, I gradually cultivated a passion in biostatistics, and applied the corresponding master degree.  

Under the guidance of Professor [Bin Cheng](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/bc2159), I start to focus on developing high-dimension count data modelling methods, and learn how to undertake methodological research since February 2018. Understanding that the inspiration always comes from the practice, I also work with Professor [Ying Wei](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/yw2148) to conduct dental malpractice data analysis since May 2018.
