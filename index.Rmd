### Student of Biostatistics
<br>
I am completing a doctoral degree of Biostatistics at [Graduate School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/), University of Pittsburgh under the guidance of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/). I am also a graduate student researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Steffi Oesterreich](https://www.pharmacology.us/Faculty/SteffiOesterreich) and [Dr. Adrian Lee](https://www.pharmacology.us/Faculty/AdrianLee) at Magee-Women's Research Institute. I was awarded M.S. of Biostatistics at [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), Columbia University and two B.S. degrees (Biotechnology and Applied Chemistry) at [School of Life Science](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/), Central China Normal University.  

Since February 2014, I had chance to work on environment-related molecular toxicology in Professor [Xu Yang](http://bio.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1053/2297.htm)'s lab. That was the begining of my interest in research of public health. During my undergraduate study, I gradually cultivated a passion in biostatistics, and applied to the corresponding master degree.  

With the guidance of Professor [Bin Cheng](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/bc2159), I started to focus on developing multivariate count data modeling methods, and learnt how to undertake methodological research since February 2018. Understanding that the inspiration always comes from the practice, I also worked with Professor [Ying Wei](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/yw2148) to conduct dental malpractice data analysis since May 2018. I recognized the fact that better solutions always come from extensive experience, and made myself available to work on different applied projects. I had a research internship on analyzing microRNA sequencing data at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) from January to May in 2019 under supervision of Dr. [Li-Xuan Qin](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/li-xuan-qin).
