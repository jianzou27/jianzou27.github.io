I am a PhD student in [<span style="color: #eb6864;">Bioinformatics and Statistical Learning Group</span>](https://tsenglab.biostat.pitt.edu) under the guidance of [<span style="color: #eb6864;">Dr. George C. Tseng</span>](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/) at University of Pittsburgh, and interested in application of data science in genomics and development of statistical tools for biological study.

### On-Going Projects
* Number of clusters selection for model based clustering and S4 method extension.
* Congruence analysis between cell lines and human tissues.
* Great Lakes Breast Cancer Consortium data analysis.
