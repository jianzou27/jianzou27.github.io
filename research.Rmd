I am a PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Statistical Learning Group](https://tsenglab.biostat.pitt.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/) at University of Pittsburgh, and interested in application of data science in genomics and development of statistical tools for biological study.
