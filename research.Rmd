I am a PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Statistical Learning Group](https://tsenglab.biostat.pitt.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/) at University of Pittsburgh, and interested in application of data science in genomics and development of statistical tools for biological study.


## Research Project
### Ongoing Project
* Cluster number and penalty parameter selection for (sparse) Gaussian mixture model
* Multi-omics data analysis for patients with breast cancer before and after hormone therapy
* Analysis of the microenviroment for patients with breast cancer and brain metastasis

### Collaboration
* Great Lakes Breast Cancer Consortium data analysis
* Outcomes after sentinel lymph node biopsy and radiotherapy in older women with early-stage, estrogen receptorâ€“positive breast cancer

### Methodology
* Multi-class concordance analysis
* Congruence analysis between cell lines and human tissues
* Constrained Gaussian mixture model
