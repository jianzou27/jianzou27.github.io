I am interested in application of data science in public health events, especially enviroment-related issues and clinical trails.

**Effects of tea polyphenols on neurotoxicity in mice**  
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCG, is the most abundant and active substance among tea polyphenols. Series of toxicity research has showed that gaseous formaldehyde and zinc ion are significantly neurovirulent. In this research, gaseous formaldehyde and zinc chloride are used as toxicants and 0.2% EGCG is used as antagonist. Behavioral experiment (Morris Maze), oxidative stress (ROS) and DNA injury degree (8-OHdG) are applied to evaluate these three substances. The experiment results show that zinc chloride and formaldehyde can cause oxidative damage in mice brain tissues while EGCG can antagonize zinc ion significantly. Furthermore, we found EGCG is both prooxidant and antioxidant.  
This is my [undergraduate thesis](downloads/undergraduate_thesis.pdf) and is written in Chinese.

**Application of Glutathione to Antagonize H2O2-induced Oxidative Stress in cells**  
With increasing industrialization, numerous air pollutants are generated. This research aimed to investigate the effects of inhalation of oxidative pollutants. H2O2 was used to simulate oxidative air pollutants, and glutathione, a reducing agent that is widely distributed in organisms, was used as an antagonist, to protect cells from oxidative stress. H2O2 was diluted using two gradients and GSH was dissolved at 20 ¦ÌM. MTT, MDA, ROS, GSH, and TSLP were used as biomarkers to evaluate oxidative stress and possible resulting molecular events. A dose-sponse relationship was observed between H2O2 concentrations and the above-mentioned biomarkers. Glutathione significantly reduced levels of oxidative stress.
