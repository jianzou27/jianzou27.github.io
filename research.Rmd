I am a PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Statistical Learning Group](https://tsenglab.biostat.pitt.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. George C. Tseng](http://www.pitt.edu/~ctseng/) at University of Pittsburgh, and interested in application of data science in genomics and development of statistical tools for biological study.

### On-Going Projects
* Number of clusters selection for model based clustering and S4 method extension.
* Resemblance analysis between cell lines and human tissues.
* Great Lakes Breast Cancer Consortium data analysis.
* Fusion transcript analysis in ovarian cancer before and after chemotherapy.
